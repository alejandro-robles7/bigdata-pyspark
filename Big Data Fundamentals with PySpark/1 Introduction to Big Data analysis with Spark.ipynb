    "# Course Description\n",
    "There's been a lot of buzz about Big Data over the past few years, and it's finally become mainstream for many companies. But what is this Big Data? This course covers the fundamentals of Big Data via PySpark. Spark is “lightning fast cluster computing\" framework for Big Data. It provides a general data processing platform engine and lets you run programs up to 100x faster in memory, or 10x faster on disk, than Hadoop. You will use PySpark, a Python package for spark programming and its powerful, higher-level libraries such as SparkSQL, MLlib (for machine learning), etc., to interact with works of William Shakespeare, analyze Fifa football 2018 data and perform clustering of genomic datasets. At the end of this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of PySpark and it’s application to general Big Data analysis."

    "## Understanding SparkContext\n",
    "A SparkContext represents the entry point to Spark functionality. It's like a key to your car. PySpark automatically creates a SparkContext for you in the PySpark shell (so you don't have to create it by yourself) and is exposed via a variable sc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple exercise, you'll find out the attributes of the SparkContext in your PySpark shell which you'll be using for the rest of the course."

    "## Interactive Use of PySpark\n",
    "Spark comes with an interactive python shell in which PySpark is already installed in it. PySpark shell is useful for basic testing and debugging and it is quite powerful. The easiest way to demonstrate the power of PySpark’s shell is to start using it. In this example, you'll load a simple list containing numbers ranging from 1 to 100 in the PySpark shell.\n",

    "The most important thing to understand here is that we are not creating any SparkContext object because PySpark automatically creates the SparkContext object named sc, by default in the PySpark shell."

    "## Use of lambda() with map()\n",

The general syntax of the filter() function is filter(function, list_of_input). Similar to the map(), filter() can be used with lambda() function. The general syntax of the filter() function with lambda() is filter(lambda <argument>:<expression>, list). Refer to slide 6 of video 1.7 for general help of the filter() function with lambda()."
