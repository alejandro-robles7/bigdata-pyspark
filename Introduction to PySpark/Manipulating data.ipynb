    "## Creating columns\n",
    "In this chapter, you'll learn how to use the methods defined by Spark's DataFrame class to perform common data operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at performing column-wise operations. In Spark you can do this using the .withColumn() method, which takes two arguments. First, a string with the name of your new column, and second the new column itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new column must be an object of class Column. Creating one of these is as easy as extracting a column from your DataFrame using df.colName.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a Spark DataFrame is somewhat different than working in pandas because the Spark DataFrame is immutable. This means that it can't be changed, and so columns can't be updated in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, all these methods return a new DataFrame. To overwrite the original DataFrame you must reassign the returned DataFrame using the method like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = df.withColumn(\"newCol\", df.oldCol + 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code creates a DataFrame with the same columns as df plus a new column, newCol, where every entry is equal to the corresponding entry from oldCol, plus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overwrite an existing column, just pass the name of the column as the first argument!"

    "## SQL in a nutshell\n",
    "As you move forward, it will help to have a basic understanding of SQL. A more in depth look can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A SQL query returns a table derived from one or more tables contained in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every SQL query is made up of commands that tell the database what you want to do with the data. The two commands that every query has to contain are SELECT and FROM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT command is followed by the columns you want in the resulting table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FROM command is followed by the name of the table that contains those columns. The minimal SQL query is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM my_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The * selects all columns, so this returns the entire table named my_table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to .withColumn(), you can do column-wise computations within a SELECT statement. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT origin, dest, air_time / 60 FROM flights;\n",
    "```\n",
    "returns a table with the origin, destination, and duration in hours for each flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another commonly used command is WHERE. This command filters the rows of the table based on some logical condition you specify. The resulting table contains the rows where your condition is true. For example, if you had a table of students and grades you could do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM students\n",
    "WHERE grade = 'A';\n",

    "to select all the columns and the rows containing information about students who got As.\n",

    "Another common database task is aggregation. That is, reducing your data by breaking it into chunks and summarizing each chunk.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to count the number of flights from each of two origin destinations, you could use the query\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "Now that you have a bit of SQL know-how under your belt, it's easier to talk about the analogous operations using Spark DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the .filter() method. As you might suspect, this is the Spark counterpart of SQL's WHERE clause. The .filter() method takes either an expression that would follow the WHERE clause of a SQL expression as a string, or a Spark Column of boolean (True/False) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following two expressions will produce the same output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "flights.filter(\"air_time > 120\").show()\n",
    "flights.filter(flights.air_time > 120).show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that in the first case, we pass a string to .filter(). In SQL, we would write this filtering task as SELECT * FROM flights WHERE air_time > 120. Spark's .filter() can accept any expression that could go in the WHEREclause of a SQL query (in this case, \"air_time > 120\"), as long as it is passed as a string. Notice that in this case, we do not reference the name of the table in the string -- as we wouldn't in the SQL request.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second case, we actually pass a column of boolean values to .filter(). Remember that flights.air_time > 120 returns a column of boolean values that has True in place of those records in flights.air_time that are over 120, and False otherwise."

This information isn't in the flights table because the same plane flies many different flights over the course of two years, so including this information in every row would result in a lot of duplication. To avoid this, you'd have a second table that has only one row for each plane and whose columns list all the information about the plane, including its tail number. You could call this table planes\n",
